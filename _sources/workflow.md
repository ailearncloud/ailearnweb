An Educator employs an intelligent agent (AI-Assistant) to design a skills-based curriculum. AI-Assistant interacts with the AI-Learn platform on behalf of the educator.

How Does AI-Learn Work?
```


- In **extraction** mode, AI-Learn automatically extracts ALAs from the web, Open Educational Resources (OER), and proprietary digital instructional materials. The work is performed by [AI-Ada](page-ada), an AI engine based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The extracted ALAs are populated in [AI-Author](page-author), the design canvas.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- In **design** mode, an educator uses [AI-Author](page-author) to create modular ALAs from scratch or edit ALAs following extraction and discovery.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- In **discovery** mode, AI-Learn performs advanced search and discovery against a digital repository [AI-Jorge](page-jorge). The AI-based recommendations are populated in the design canvas. AI-Jorge is also a marketplace for exchanging ALAs based on license terms set by educators and institutions. Educators can also tag, rate, annotate, and recommend ALAs.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- In **deployment** mode, AI-Learn deploys ALAs to intelligent tutoring systems and learning management systems using standard protocols such as 1EDTECH's [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability).
