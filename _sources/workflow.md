How does AI-Learn work? To develop a skills-based curriculum, an educator begins and authoring wizard and design canvas [AI-Author](page-author). An intelligent agent (AI-Assistant) is in the background to aid the educator with the most common tasks or modes.

How Does AI-Learn Work?
```

The AI-Learn workflow consists of the following primary modes:

- In **extract** mode, an educator automatically extracts ALAs by issuing a series of prompts. A simple prompt is to ask for an ALA based on a topic. AI-Learn then automatically generates the ALA. The work of extraction is performed by [AI-Ada](page-ada), an AI engine based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The extracted ALAs are populated in the design canvas for review and edit. AI-Ada can automatically extract ALAs for most STEM fields *without* prior training. AI-Ada can also extract ALAs from proprietary digital materials or Open Educational Resources (OER) with additional modest training.

- In **edit** mode, an educator uses [AI-Author](page-author) to create modular ALAs from scratch or edit ALAs following extraction and discovery.

- In **discover** mode, an educator performs advanced search and discovery against a digital repository [AI-Jorge](page-jorge). AI-Jorge contains pre-configured ALAs contributed by the educational community and curated by domain experts. The discovered ALAs are populated in the design canvas for review and edit.

- In **deploy** mode, an educator deploys ALAs to intelligent tutoring systems and learning management systems using standard protocols such as 1EDTECH's [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability). ALAs can also be deployed to [AI-Emmy](page-emmy), a next-generation intelligent tutoring system.

- In **evaluate** and **improve** mode, an educator evaluates ALAs using the AI-Learn analytics engine [AI-Alonzo](page-alonzo). The analytics ranges from simple methods such as item analysis to propensity modeling and causal inferencing. AI-Alonzo can also generates recommendations for improving ALAs based on observational data. ALA "improvements" are recorded in a "scientific logbook" of modifications under the structure of hypothesis-experiment-data.

- In **share** mode, an educator can share and license ALAs. AI-Jorge, therefore, is also a marketplace for exchanging ALAs based on license terms set by educators and institutions. Educators can also tag, rate, annotate, and recommend ALAs.
