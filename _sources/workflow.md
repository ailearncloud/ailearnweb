How does AI-Learn work? An Educator begins with a design canvas and authorizing wizard (AI-Author) to develop a skills-based curriculum. An intelligent agent (AI-Assistant) is there in the background to aid the educator with the most common tasks.

How Does AI-Learn Work?
```

- In **extract** mode, an educator automatically extracts ALAs by issuing a series of simple prompts. The work of extraction is performed by [AI-Ada](page-ada), an AI engine based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The extracted ALAs are populated in the design canvas for review and edit. AI-Ada can automatically extract ALAs for most STEM fields *without* prior training. AI-Ada can also extract ALAs from digital proprietary or Open Educational Resources (OER) with additional training.

- In **edit** mode, an educator uses [AI-Author](page-author) to create modular ALAs from scratch or edit ALAs following extraction and discovery (see below).

- In **discover** mode, an educator performs advanced search and discovery against a digital repository [AI-Jorge](page-jorge). AI-Jorge contains pre-configured ALAs contributed by the educational community and curated by domain experts. The discovered ALAs are populated in the design canvas for review and edit.

- In **deploy** mode, an educator deploys ALAs to intelligent tutoring systems and learning management systems using standard protocols such as 1EDTECH's [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability).

- In **evaluate** and **improve** mode, an educator evaluates ALAs using the AI-Learn analytics engine AI-Alonzo. The presented analysis ranges from simple methods such as item analysis to efficacy analysis using causal inference. AI-Alonzo also generates recommendations for improving ALAs. AI-Assistant maintains a "scientific logbook" of modifications under the structure of hypothesis-experiment-data.

- In **share** mode, AI-Jorge is also a marketplace for exchanging ALAs based on license terms set by educators and institutions. Educators can also tag, rate, annotate, and recommend ALAs.
