The central metaphor of AI-Learn is a pilot flying an airplane. Similarly, an Educator uses the AI-Cockpit to design, deploy, and improve a skills-based curriculum. Common tasks are presented as instruments in the AI-Cockpit. For example, the instrument for the design tasks are an authoring wizard and design canvas. The educator has an aid an intelligent agent called AI-Assistant.

How Does AI-Learn Work?
```

A typical session might consists of various modes, where each mode corresponds to a major task as part of the design workflow: 

- In **extraction** mode, AI-Learn automatically extracts ALAs from the web, Open Educational Resources (OER), or proprietary digital instructional materials. Behind the scenes, the work is performed by [AI-Ada](page-ada): an AI engine based on Large Language Models (LLMs). The extracted ALAs are then populated in AI-Author, the design canvas for review and edits.

- In **design** mode, an educator uses [AI-Author](page-author) to create modular ALAs from scratch or edit ALAs following extraction and discovery.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- In **discovery** mode, AI-Learn performs advanced search and discovery against a digital repository [AI-Jorge](page-jorge). The AI-based recommendations are populated in AI-Author. AI-Jorge is also a marketplace for exchanging ALAs based on license terms set by educators and institutions. Educators can also tag, rate, annotate, and recommend ALAs.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

- In **deployment** mode, AI-Learn deploys ALAs to intelligent tutoring systems and learning management systems using standard protocols such as 1EDTECH's [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability).
