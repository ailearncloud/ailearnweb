The cornerstone of AI-Learn’s pedagogical design are smart, modularized Aligned Learning Activities (ALAs). An ALA is an aligned semantic triple consisting of a learning objective, assessments and learning activities.

# <font color="maroon">Backward Design</font>

Traditional learning design is based on a “forward design” process. Instructors typically begin with learning materials such as a textbook, develop assessments, primarily quizzes and test, and then eveventually get around to learning goals.

Research evidence strongly suggests that learning outcomes can be improved by a backward design process. In backward design learning goals and learning objectives are formulated first. They state the knowledge and skills students are expected to master. The second stage defines the assessments that will measure and evaluate whether students have attained the goals and learning objectives. The assessments are ongoing and primarily formative, meaning low-stakes. Finally, the instructional activities and learning materials come last. The final stage defines how students are expected to master the knowledge and skills defined during the first stage.

# ALAs and Adaptive Learning Systems
The use of Aligned Learning Activities for designing next-generation adaptive learning systems is described in detail in “A possible future for next generation adaptive learning systems.” [Ess16].
