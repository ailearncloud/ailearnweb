# <font color="maroon">Overview</font>

AI-Learn is an open-source toolset and digital platform for creating modular skills-based curriculums. We cut out the middlemen by placing AI-powered tools directly in the hands of educators. Using AI-Learn, an educator can **design** a custom skills-based curriculum, **deploy** it to an intelligent tutoring system or learning management system, **evaluate** what is working and what needs to change, **improve** specific instructional resources to make the curriculum more effective, and **share** the work and data, with colleagues, educational researchers, and the global educational community. AI-Learn is powered by AI Large Language Models (LLMs), also called pre-trained Transformers.

We believe that every citizen should have access to affordable, quality education. Our mission is to dramatically *reduce the cost* of curriculum development for skills-based training by at least (**10 X**) and to *improve educational achievement* of learners, including those from historically marginalized communities, by at least (**.5 effect size**).
