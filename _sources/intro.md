AI-Learn is an open-source toolset and digital platform for creating modular skills-based curriculums. We cut out the middlemen by placing AI-powered tools directly in the hands of educators. Using AI-Learn, an educator can **design** an entire skills-based curriculum, **deploy** it to an intelligent tutoring system or learning management system, **evaluate** what is working and what needs to change, **improve** specific instructional materials to increase learning efficacy, and **share** the work and data, with colleagues, educational researchers, and the global educational community. AI-Learn is powered by AI Large Language Models (LLMs).

AI-Learn Workflow
```

The centerpiece of AI-Learn is AI-Author, a design workbench for creating skills-based curriculums. An educator uses AI-Author to automatically generate a learning module or an entire curriculum from AI-Learnâ€™s LLM using simple prompts. The curriculum is configured as a set of smart learning atoms, called Aligned Learning Activities (ALAs). An ALA is a semantic triple consisting of a learning objective, assessments, and learning activities. The educator then uses AI-Author to edit, deploy, discover, evaluate, improve, and share ALAs using the AI-Learn digital platform.

We believe that every citizen should have access to affordable, quality education. Our mission is to dramatically *reduce the cost* of curriculum development for skills-based training by at least (**10 X**) and to *improve educational achievement* of learners, including those from historically marginalized communities, by at least (**.5 effect size**).
