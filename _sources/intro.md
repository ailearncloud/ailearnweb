# <font color="maroon">Overview</font>

AI-Learn is an open-source toolset and digital platform for creating skills-based curriculums. We cut out the middlemen by placing AI-powered tools directly in the hands of educators. Using AI-Learn, an educator can **design** and customize a skills-based curriculum, **deploy** it to an intelligent tutoring system or learning management system, **evaluate** what is working and what needs to change, **improve** instructional materials to make it more effective, and **share** work and data with colleagues, educational researchers, and the global educational community. AI-Learn is powered by Deep Learning Large Language Models (LLMs).

# <font color="maroon">Mission</font>

Every citizen should have access to affordable, quality education. Our goal is to dramatically *reduce the cost* of curriculum development for skills-based training by at least (**10 X**) and to *improve educational achievement* of historically marginalized learners by at least (**.5 effect size**).


# <font color="maroon">How Does AI-Learn Work?</font>

An Educator works with an intelligent agent (AI-Assistant) to perform the tasks of designing a skills-based curriculum. AI-Assistant interacts with the AI-Learn platform on behalf of the educator.

The AI-Learn platform consists of six major components:

- **[AI-Learn Author](page-author)** is an authoring wizard and design canvas for creating a skills based curriculum.

- **[AI-Learn Ada](page-ada)**  is a AI-based extraction engine (based on a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-large-language-models-will-transform-science-society-and-ai)) for automatically generating a recommended curriculum based on a topic.

- **[AI-Learn Alonzo](page-alonzo)** is an AI-based analytics engine for generating advanced insights and evaluating learning efficacy of a deployed curriculum.

- **[AI-Learn Emmy](page-emmy)** is an AI-based intelligent tutoring system.

- **[AI-Learn Jorge](page-jorge)** is a "crowd-sourced" searchable digital repository of pre-configured curriculum materials with robust IP management.

- **[AI-Learn Maryam](page-maryam)** is AI-Learn's digital infrastructure, including cloud-based services for security, scalability, and integration.
