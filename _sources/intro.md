# <font color="maroon">Overview</font>

We started **AI-Learn** because every citizen should have access to affordable, effective education. We support educators with open source AI tools to train knowledge workers, not just once but throughout a lifetime. We cut out the middlemen by providing educators and domain experts with AI tools to create skills-based curriculums, deploy the curriculum into intelligent tutoring systems, and receive actionable insights on what's working and what needs improvement. Our goal is to dramatically reduce the cost of curriculum development for skills-based training, but we also think that it is just as important to provide educational opportunities for reskilling and upskilling to historically marginalized learners.  

## <font color="maroon">What is AI Learn?</font>

**AI-Learn** is a fully open-source AI-based educational platform and toolset for extracting, discovering, creating, sharing, and deploying digitally smart Aligned Learning Activities (ALAs). [ALAs](page-ala) are data-enabled <font color="blue">**Smart Learning Atoms**</font> for driving next-generation AI-based teaching and learning.

## <font color="maroon">Platform</font>

The AI-Learn platform consists of six major components:

```

- **[AI-Learn Author](page-author)** is an authoring wizard and design canvas for extracting, editing, and deploying ALAs. It is the primary end user tool for interacting with the platform.

- **[AI-Learn Ada](page-ada)**  is a AI-based extraction engine (based on a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-large-language-models-will-transform-science-society-and-ai)) for automatically generating ALAs.  

- **[AI-Learn Alonzo](page-alonzo)** is an AI-based analytics engine for generating advanced insights and evaluating learning efficacy of deployed ALAs based on causal inferencing.

- **[AI-Learn Emmy](page-emmy)** is an AI-based intelligent tutoring system.

- **[AI-Learn Jorge](page-jorge)** is a "crowd-sourced" searchable digital repository of pre-configured ALAs with robust IP management.

- **[AI-Learn Maryam](page-maryam)** is AI-Learn's digital infrastructure, including cloud-based services for security, scalability, and integration.

# <font color="maroon">Why AI-Learn?</font>

AI-Learn is a set of next-generation AI-based tools for democratizing education by lowering costs and increasing value.


AI-learn lowers costs by:

- automating the tedious parts of curriculum development
- harnessing the power of OER (Open Educational Resources)
- providing an open digital library of smart instructional resources
- leveraging open source software, methodologies and governance

AI-learn increases value by:

- enabling easy customization of instruction for vital new areas such as workforce development and adult learning

- delivering “just-in-time” advanced analytics

- crowd-sourcing instructional quality monitoring and evaluation

- establishing a market place for exchanging and monetizing instructional materials
