# <font color="maroon">Overview</font>

AI-Learn is an open-source toolset and digital platform for creating custom skills-based curriculums. We cut out the middlemen by placing AI-powered tools directly in the hands of educators. Using AI-Learn, an educator can **design** a customized skills-based curriculum, **deploy** it to an intelligent tutoring system or learning management system, **evaluate** what is working and what needs correction, **improve** instruction to make it more effective, and finally **share** the work and data with colleagues, educational researchers, and the global educational community.

AI-Learn is powered by Deep Learning Large Language Models (LLMs).  LLMs represent a breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI). By using pre-trained LLMS it is now possible to enable complex tasks with little training data.



# <font color="maroon">Mission</font>

Every citizen should have access to affordable, quality education. Our goal is to dramatically <font color="blue">*reduce the cost*</font> of curriculum development for skills-based training by at least (10x) and to <font color="blue">*improve educational achievement*</font> of historically marginalized learners by at least (.5 effect size).


# <font color="maroon">Platform</font>

The AI-Learn platform consists of six major components:

```

- **[AI-Learn Author](page-author)** is an authoring wizard and design canvas for extracting, editing, and deploying ALAs. It is the primary end user tool for interacting with the platform.

- **[AI-Learn Ada](page-ada)**  is a AI-based extraction engine (based on a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-large-language-models-will-transform-science-society-and-ai)) for automatically generating ALAs.  

- **[AI-Learn Alonzo](page-alonzo)** is an AI-based analytics engine for generating advanced insights and evaluating learning efficacy of deployed ALAs based on causal inferencing.

- **[AI-Learn Emmy](page-emmy)** is an AI-based intelligent tutoring system.

- **[AI-Learn Jorge](page-jorge)** is a "crowd-sourced" searchable digital repository of pre-configured ALAs with robust IP management.

- **[AI-Learn Maryam](page-maryam)** is AI-Learn's digital infrastructure, including cloud-based services for security, scalability, and integration.

# <font color="maroon">Why AI-Learn?</font>

AI-Learn is a set of next-generation AI-based tools for democratizing education by lowering costs and increasing value.


AI-learn lowers costs by:

- automating the tedious parts of curriculum development
- harnessing the power of OER (Open Educational Resources)
- providing an open digital library of smart instructional resources
- leveraging open source software, methodologies and governance

AI-learn increases value by:

- enabling easy customization of instruction for vital new areas such as workforce development and adult learning

- delivering “just-in-time” advanced analytics

- crowd-sourcing instructional quality monitoring and evaluation

- establishing a market place for exchanging and monetizing instructional materials
