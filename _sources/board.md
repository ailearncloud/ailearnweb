Philip Pavlik is an Associate Professor at the [Institute for Intelligent Systems at the University of Memphis](https://www.memphis.edu/iis/). Since 2001 he has focused on the effects of practice and forgetting on performance in fact and concept learning tasks. The ultimate goals of this research are to create accurate mathematical models of practice and forgetting that can be used to understand the factors governing task performance and then to use these models to improve performance in educational settings. This work applies principles from both economics and cognitive psychology to look for how to schedule practice for maximal benefits for the student, according to the model.
 
Pavlik's approach is informed by his training at Carnegie Mellon, where he worked with renowned researchers John Anderson and Ken Koedinger. As a graduate student working with [John Anderson](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/anderson-john.html), Pavlik developed new learning models and applied them to instructional strategy optimization. This work continued as a postdoc and systems scientist with [Ken Koedinger](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/ken-koedinger), co-director of the 10-year [Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center (LearnLab)](https://learnlab.org/), where Pavlik collaborated on multiple projects working to apply student model-informed practice in multiple contexts.
 
At the University of Memphis, Pavlik leads the [Optimal Learning Lab](http://optimallearning.org/#:~:text=The%20Optimal%20Learning%20Lab%20at,to%20sequence%20and%20schedule%20practice.), which applies cognitive theory and methods to educational contexts. He and his students have investigated learning in various domains, including mathematics, language learning, statistics, musical learning, and anatomy and physiology. In this work, he develops software and tools for educational applications, such as the Mobile Fact and Concept Training System (MoFaCTS), which serves as a testbed for educational interventions, and the R package logistic knowledge tracing (LKT), which aims to make student modeling more efficient and accurate.

Oleksandra, or Sasha, Poquet is Assistant Professor in Learning Analytics at the [Department of Educational Sciences](https://www.edu.sot.tum.de/en/edu/home/), School of Social Sciences and Technology, [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/). She is also an adjunct researcher affiliated with the [Centre for Change and Complexity in Learning](https://www.unisa.edu.au/research/c3l/) at the University of South Australia. At the TUM, she leads a research group LEAPS that is interested in LEarning Analytics and Practices in Systems. In the past, she has worked as a researcher at the [Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (University of Paris)](https://mooc.global/cri/), Centre for Change and Complexity in Learning (University of South Australia), and [Applied Institute of Learning Science and Educational Technology (National University of Singapore)](https://nus.edu.sg/alset/our-staff/).

Sasha’s work is driven by an understanding that learning is not just about any change, but is related to learner transformation and development. Her research provides a strong foundation for interventions that facilitate peer learning in digital settings at the university-level, at the course-level, and at a task-level. She has a keen interest in complexity science and applies complex systems lens to her work, analyzing learners, groups of learners, and learning organizations. She is interested in modelling learning as networked, dynamic, adaptive, multi-level process among heterogeneous individuals. Sasha’s research is both explanatory and descriptive. Sasha was a [Vice-President of the Executive Committee of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR)](https://www.solaresearch.org/about/governance/), and remains an active member of the learning analytics community.
