Philip Pavlik is Associate Professor at Institute for Intelligent Systems at University of Memphis. Since January 2001, his research program has focused on the effects of practice and forgetting on performance in fact memory tasks. The ultimate goals of this research are to formulate accurate mathematical models of practice and forgetting that can be used to understand the factors governing recall performance and to use these models to improve performance in educational settings. 

 Since September 2005, his research has broadened from simple declarative memories to consider learning knowledge components that are transferable, procedural, have multiple components and/or are generalizable. Since 2008 as a systems scientist,his research continues to follow some previous themes, but with a new focus on understanding knowledge dependency structures and conceptual learning.

Oleksandra, or Sasha, Poquet is Assistant Professor in Learning Analytics at the Department of Educational Sciences, School of Social Sciences and Technology, Technical University of Munich. She is also an adjunct researcher affiliated with the Centre for Change and Complexity in Learning at the University of South Australia. At the TUM, she leads a research group LEAPS that is interested in LEarning Analytics and Practices in Systems. In the past, she has worked as a researcher at the Centre for Research and Interdisciplinarity (University of Paris), Centre for Change and Complexity in Learning (University of South Australia), and Applied Institute of Learning Science and Educational Technology (National University of Singapore).

Sasha’s work is driven by an understanding that learning is not just about any change, but is related to learner transformation and development. Her research provides a strong foundation for interventions that facilitate peer learning in digital settings at the university-level, at the course-level, and at a task-level. She has a keen interest in complexity science and applies complex systems lens to her work, analyzing learners, groups of learners, and learning organizations. She is interested in modelling learning as networked, dynamic, adaptive, multi-level process among heterogeneous individuals. Sasha’s research is both explanatory and descriptive. Sasha was a Vice-President of the Executive Committee of the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR), and remains an active member of the learning analytics community.
