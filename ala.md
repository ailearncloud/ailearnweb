The cornerstone of AI-Learn’s pedagogical design are smart, learning atoms called Aligned Learning Activities (ALAs). An ALA is an aligned semantic triple consisting of a) a learning objective, b) assessments, and c) learning activities. The assessments and learning activities are aligned to a particular learning objective.

# <font color="maroon">Why ALAs?</font>

Traditional learning design is based on a “forward design” process. Instructors typically begin with learning materials such as a textbook, develop assessments (primarily quizzes and test), and then eventually get around to learning goals. 

Research evidence strongly suggests that learning outcomes can be improved by a backward design process. In backward design, learning objectives are formulated first. A learning objective states the knowledge or skill a student is expected to master. The second stage defines the evidence, in the form of assessements, that will be used to know whether a student has achieved a learning objective and to what degree. The assessments are ongoing and primarily formative. Unlike quizzes and tests, formative assessments are designed to provide actionable feedback to both the learner and the instructor. In backward design, the instructional activities and learning materials are formulated last. The final stage defines how students are expected to master a learning objective. Students learn by doing, not viewing. Learning activities should go beyond passive learning (e.g. reading a textbook, watching a video) to include active and collaborative learning (e.g. solving problems, peer learning). In short, an aligned learning activity captures the backward design process as a modular learning atom.
