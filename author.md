**AI-Learn Author** is an authoring wizard and design canvas for extracting, editing, and deploying ALAs. It is the primary end user tool for interacting with the platform.

The end user, typically an instructor or learning designer, interacts with AI-Learn by using AI-Author. The user is presented with a design canvas.

- In **extraction** mode, the AI-Author wizard automatically extracts ALAs from the web, Open Educational Resources (OER), and proprietary digital instructional materials. The work is performed by [AI-Ada](page-ada), an AI engine based on Large Language Models (LLMs).
- In **discovery** mode, AI-Author performs advanced search and discovery against a digital repository [AI-Jorge](page-jorge). The AI-based recommendations are populated in the design canvas. AI-Jorge is also a marketplace for exchanging ALAs based on license terms set by individual and institutional contributors. Instructors can also tag, rate, annotate, and recommend ALAs.
- In **design** mode, AI-Author allows the user to create modular ALAs from scratch or edit ALAs after extraction and discovery.
- In **deployment** mode, AI-Author deploys ALAs to learning management systems using standard protocols such as 1EDTECH's [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability).
