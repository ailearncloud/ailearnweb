# <font color="maroon">Overview</font>

AI-Learn is an open-source toolset and digital platform for creating customized skills-based curriculums. We cut out the middlemen by placing AI-powered tools directly in the hands of educators and domain experts. Using AI-Learn, an educator can *design* a customized skills-based curriculum, *deploy* it to an intelligent tutoring system or learning management system, *evaluate* what is working and what needs improvement, *improve* the elements that can be made more effective, and finally *share* their work and data with colleagues, educational researchers, and the global educational community. AI-Learn is powered by Deep Learning Large Language Models (LLMs).

Our goal is to dramatically reduce the cost of curriculum development for skills-based training, but we also think that it is just as important to accelerate educational opportunities for reskilling and upskilling to historically marginalized learners.

The AI-Learn platform consists of six major components:

```

- **[AI-Learn Author](page-author)** is an authoring wizard and design canvas for extracting, editing, and deploying ALAs. It is the primary end user tool for interacting with the platform.

- **[AI-Learn Ada](page-ada)**  is a AI-based extraction engine (based on a [Large Language Model (LLM)](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-large-language-models-will-transform-science-society-and-ai)) for automatically generating ALAs.  

- **[AI-Learn Alonzo](page-alonzo)** is an AI-based analytics engine for generating advanced insights and evaluating learning efficacy of deployed ALAs based on causal inferencing.

- **[AI-Learn Emmy](page-emmy)** is an AI-based intelligent tutoring system.

- **[AI-Learn Jorge](page-jorge)** is a "crowd-sourced" searchable digital repository of pre-configured ALAs with robust IP management.

- **[AI-Learn Maryam](page-maryam)** is AI-Learn's digital infrastructure, including cloud-based services for security, scalability, and integration.

# <font color="maroon">Why AI-Learn?</font>

AI-Learn is a set of next-generation AI-based tools for democratizing education by lowering costs and increasing value.


AI-learn lowers costs by:

- automating the tedious parts of curriculum development
- harnessing the power of OER (Open Educational Resources)
- providing an open digital library of smart instructional resources
- leveraging open source software, methodologies and governance

AI-learn increases value by:

- enabling easy customization of instruction for vital new areas such as workforce development and adult learning

- delivering “just-in-time” advanced analytics

- crowd-sourcing instructional quality monitoring and evaluation

- establishing a market place for exchanging and monetizing instructional materials
