An Educator works with an intelligent agent (AI-Assistant) to perform the tasks of designing a skills-based curriculum. AI-Assistant interacts with the AI-Learn platform on behalf of the educator.

How Does AI-Learn Work?
```


 In **extraction** mode, the AI-Author wizard automatically extracts ALAs from the web, Open Educational Resources (OER), and proprietary digital instructional materials. The work is performed by [AI-Ada](page-ada), an AI engine based on Large Language Models (LLMs).
- In **discovery** mode, AI-Author performs advanced search and discovery against a digital repository [AI-Jorge](page-jorge). The AI-based recommendations are populated in the design canvas. AI-Jorge is also a marketplace for exchanging ALAs based on license terms set by individual and institutional contributors. Instructors can also tag, rate, annotate, and recommend ALAs.
- In **design** mode, AI-Author allows the user to create modular ALAs from scratch or edit ALAs after extraction and discovery.
- In **deployment** mode, AI-Author deploys ALAs to learning management systems using standard protocols such as 1EDTECH's [Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability).

The AI-Learn platform consists of six major components:

- **[AI-Learn Author](page-author)** is an authoring wizard and design canvas for creating a skills based curriculum.

- **[AI-Learn Ada](page-ada)**  is a AI-based extraction engine for automatically generating a recommended curriculum based on topics.

- **[AI-Learn Alonzo](page-alonzo)** is an AI-based analytics engine for generating advanced insights and evaluating learning efficacy.

- **[AI-Learn Emmy](page-emmy)** is an AI-based intelligent tutoring system for delivering a personalized curriculum to each learner.

- **[AI-Learn Jorge](page-jorge)** is a "crowd-sourced" searchable digital repository of pre-configured curriculum materials with robust IP management.

- **[AI-Learn Maryam](page-maryam)** is AI-Learn's digital infrastructure, including cloud-based services for security, scalability, and integration.
